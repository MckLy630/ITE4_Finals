			A Short Biography of <br>
			Venerable Ignacia del Espiritu Santo <br>
			(Foundress of the Congregation of the RELIGIOUS OF THE VIRGIN MARY)
		</h1>

		<div class="paragraph">
			<p>
				"Venerable Ignacia del Espiritu Santo is the genuine product of the nation in the highest order," 
				runs an article in the September 7, 1893 issue of the weekly newspaper, La Illustracion Filipina. 
				She was the foundress of a religious institution that still lives vigorously its pristine spirit 
				through centuries after its foundation.
			</p>
		</div>

		<div class="paragraph">
			<p>
				Data on the early life of Mother Ignacia is very sketchy; the whole summary is recorded in her 
				baptismal entry. The Libro de Bautismos de la iglesia de los Santos Reyes de Parian states that 
				she was the daughter of Jusepeluco and Maria Geronima, and baptized on March 4, 1663, with 
				Catalina Malinang as godmother. The same record gives her devotional name "del Espiritu Santo," 
				a providential choice which may have been a manifestation of her parents' devotion or the 
				suggestion of the officiating priest.
			</p>
		</div>

		<div class="paragraph">
			<p>
				The next record we have of his charismatic figure is given us by the 
				Jesuit historian, Fr. Pedro Murillo Velarde, who gives a comprehensive 
				account of the grown-up Ignacia. In 1684, when she was twenty-one year 
				old, Ignacia's parents decided it was time for her to get married, However, 
				matrimony held no attraction to Ignacia. She was more inclined to a life of 
				total dedication to God, and the Beaterio de Santa Catalina seemed to the
				answer.
			</p>
		</div>

		<div class="paragraph">
			<p>
				Seeking direction from the Jesuit, Fr. Paul Klein, she was advised to 
				make the Spiritual Exercises of St. Ignatius so that God's will may be made 
				known to her. At the end of her retreat, her inspiration took form in the 
				resolution: "to remain in the service of the Divine Majesty and to live by the
				Sweat of her brow."
			</p>
		</div>

		<div class="paragraph">
			<p>
				This personal decision did not remain a sterile ambition, but was 
				fulfilled. Her faith, courage, generous self-sacrifice and charity inspired 
				other native girls to join her. What resulted was a steady increase of 
				members whose life of service attracted many more to follow her example.
			</p>
		</div>

		<div class="paragraph">
			<p>
				With the growth of the community there arose the need for some 
				structure and order life. This was provided by the Jesuits who directed 
				the group in formulating a written set of rules patterned after the Ignatian 
				spirituality. Thus was born the "Beaterio de la Compania', which developed 
				into the congregation of the Religious of the Virgin Mary (RVM) of the 
				twentieth century. The spirit of poverty, humility, penance, confidence in 
				God and unbounded charity that characterized her long life became the 
				distinguishing marks of her daughters.
			</p>
		</div>

		<div class="paragraph">
			<p>
				Service to their neighbor and the overflow of their love of God was 
				manifested in the beatas' contribution to the spread of the retreat 
				movement for women in the country. Soon the institution started accepting 
				young girls as resident pupils, and the beatas expanded their apostolate to 
				education.
			</p>
		</div>

		<div class="paragraph">
			<p>
				Venerable Ignacia del Espiritu Santo died on September 10, 1748. 
				Tradition tells us that she went back to her creator after receiving Holy 
				Communion in the Church of St. Ignatius. Fr. Murillo Velarde paid the 
				highest tribute to her when he described her as the truly valiant woman, 
				"mortified, patient, devout, deeply spiritual, very humble, and zealous for 
				the good of souls."
			</p>
		</div>

		<div class="paragraph">
			<p>
				Today, the Religious of the Virgin Mary collaborates with the Church in 
				various ministries in the Philippines and overseas mission. The RVM Sisters 
				minister to God's people through education, retreat direction, catechetic, 
				dormitory and seminary apostolate, pastoral and social work, and other 
				ministries where they are needed through which God's greater glory may 
				be served.
