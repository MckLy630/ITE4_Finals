			SAINT MARY'S ACADEMY OF CAPIZ <br>
			Roxas City
		</h1>

		<div class="paragraph">
			<p>
				In the early part of 1947, a group of Catholic parents who earnestly
				desired to give a solid Christian Education to their children, decided
				upon a bold venture of founding a school to be managed by a Religious
				Congregation in due time. The school was known as the Immaculate
				Conception Academy. This noble endeavor was pioneered by the late Msgr.
				Vicente Gonzales, Mrs. Maria Ford, Mrs. Maria Diaz, Mrs. Aurora Salgado, Mrs.
				Candida Belo, Mrs. Carmen Consing, Mrs. Ramona Frial, Ex. Gov Lodovico
				Hidrosillo and Atty. Santiago Abella Vito.
			</p>
		</div>

		<div class="paragraph">
			<p>
				In July 1947, five educators, four of whom were models and long
				experienced teachers in the public schools of Roxas City, began the
				pioneering work of educating the young citizens in the city. A nipa building
				at Rizal Street was erected and rented by the parents to accomodate
				the two-hundred eithy (280) Grades One to Four pupils. Later, the Patricio
				residence in Legaspi Street was also used. The public cooperated splendidly
				by giving material aid to the newly founded school. Mrs. Maria Ford and
				Mrs. Maria Diaz helped very much in extending financial assistance to the
				teachers.
			</p>
		</div>

		<div class="paragraph">
			<p>
				In the S.Y. 1948 - 1949, classes were opened for Grades Five and Six. The
				first batch of twenty-four (24) Grade Sixpupils graduated in 1950. Enrollment
				increased which compelled some parents to seek financial assistance from
				Archbishop Jose Ma. Cuenco, Archbishop of Jaro to which Roxas City then
				belonged. They also requested for a Religious Congregation to take over
				the school. A year later, Archbishop Cuenco invited the Congregation of the
				Religious of the Virgin Mary (RVM) to administer the school. Rev Mo. Ma.
				Andrea Montejo, RVM, the Superior General of the RVM Congregation made
				an ocular visit with S. Ma. Felisa Quintia, RVM, a native Capiceña, and S. Ma.
				Gertrudis Lim, RVM. The following year, S. Ma. Isabel Purificacion, RVM was
				appointed as School Administrator. These three (3) Sisters formed the first
				RVM Community in Roxas CIty.
			</p>
		</div>

		<div class="paragraph">
			<p>
				In June 1950, a complete Secondary Course exclusive for girls was
				opened. Classes began in another rented nipa house. Mrs Elena Villareal
				and Mrs. Alice J. Argos joined the faculty line-up.
			</p>
		</div>

		<div class="paragraph">
			<p>
				Upon the recommendation of the Board of Trustees, and wuth the help
				of the late Msgr. Teodulfo Castro, a more appropriate site of the school
				was purchased through a loan from DBP and the construction of the sami-
				concrete building was started. On December 8, 1950, the new building was
				blessed. The school was named <b>Saint Mary's Academy of Capiz</b>, in honor
				of the Blessed Virgin to whom the Congregation is devoted.
			</p>
		</div>

		<div class="paragraph">
			<p>
				The Grade School Department was granted government recognition
				on July 1, 1949 while the High School was recognized on June 15, 1953
				simultaneous with the Kindergarten Course.
			</p>
		</div>

		<div class="paragraph">
			<p>
				In 1955, S. Ma. Isabel Purificacion, RVM worked for the course Associate
				in Music for some talented students in piano, but later, because there were
				few enrollees, it was discontinued.
			</p>
		</div>

		<div class="paragraph">
			<p>
				In 1960, during the term of S. Ma. Dolores Verceles, RVM, a two-year
				Secretial and Home Arts were applied for, and the name of the school
				was changed to <b>Saint Mary's College.</b> But again, because of the few enrollees,
				the two-year courses had to be phased out. Since then until the present,
				the school retained the name <b>Saint Mary's Academy of Capiz.</b>
			</p>
		</div>

		<div class="paragraph">
			<p>
				In 1963, a bigger chapel was constructed to serve the spiritual needs of
				the growing school community.
			</p>
		</div>

		<div class="paragraph">
			<p>
				The Increasing enrollment in the High School Department necessitated
				the Construction of a three-story building at the back of the Elementary
				Building in 1968 during the term of S. Ma. Esperanza Edralin, RVM.
			</p>
		</div>

		<div class="paragraph">
			<p>
				In 1972, Saint Mary's Academy of Capiz celebrated its silver jubilee. The
				12 stars on the crown of the Blessed Virgin's statue, which symbolize Mary's
				Virtues, connoted an added and special meaning to the SMAC community.
				They represented the 12 Religious Sisters, produced by the school as well
				as the eight ordained priests, one of whom became a bishop, the Most Rev.
				Gabriel V. Reyes, DD.
			</p>
		</div>

		<div class="paragraph">
			<p>
				In S.Y. 1973 - 1974, St. Mary's Academy of Capiz, through the leadership
				of S. Ma. Dolores Verceles, RVM ventured into accepting boys in its High
				School Department. The first batch of SMAC boys with 24 girls graduated in
				1977.
			</p>
		</div>

		<div class="paragraph">
			<p>
				In November of S.Y. 1984 - 1985, Saint Mary's Academy of Capiz suffered
				from cyclonic typhoon "Undang" which destroyed partially the High
				School Building. The Administrator, with S. Ma. Angelina Prado, RVM as
				Superior and S. Ma Magdalena Monteza, RVM as Principal, tapped the
				parents and alumni for the repair of the facilities.
			</p>
		</div>

		<div class="paragraph">
			<p>
				On its 40th year, in 1989 - 1990, the population of Saint Mary's Academy
				of Capiz reached more than a thousand. The Directress, S. Ma. Juanita
				J. Coruña, RVM requested help from the Family Council to construct a
				covered walk from the main gate to the Elementary building. An exit road
				for vehicles during rainy days and a shed for those waiting for the children's
				dismissal were likewise constructed through the generosity of the parents.
				The canteen was remodeled and a drinking fountain was installed.
			</p>
		</div>

		<div class="paragraph">
			<p>
				An annex of the High School Building was constructed in March 1990.
				The building accommodated three classrooms, the High School Library,
				the Science Laboratory, the CL and Guidance Offices. It was blessed on
				December 5, 1990. The sports facilities also needed improvement so a
				basketball court and a volleyball court were constructed in April, 1991
				and 1993, respectively. A shed constructed for the players was eventually
				improved to accommodate the Mother Ignacia Skills Training Center, the
				Computer room. the PEHM and CAT offices.
			</p>
		</div>
		
		<div class="paragraph">
			<p>
				In connection with the institution's thrust for the poor, Sitio Kalubihan
				was adopted in 1991 as its venue for the implementation of its Mother
				Ignacia Extension Program entitled "Sitio Kalubihan Socio-Economic and
				Evangelization Program". A full name social worker was hired. Likewise,
				Capricho Elementary School, a public elementary school near Saint Mary's
				became a recipient of the social concerns program of the Grade SchoolPupils.
			</p>
		</div>

		<div class="paragraph">
			<p>
				Simultaneous with the improvement of the physical plan and its
				facilities was a self-survey of the areas of operation for the High School
				Department using the Philippine Accrediting Association of Schools,
				Colleges and Universities (PAASCU) guidelines. On February 15 - 16, 1993
				a team of PAASCU accreditors visited the department. PAASCU issued its
				stamp of approval through a certificate dated August 30, 1993. One year
				preparation was given before the Formal Visit in October 10 - 11, 1994 for
				which the department was granted initian accreditation for three years.
			</p>
		</div>

		<div class="paragraph">
			<p>
				Since the school's population had increased in all levels, it necessitated
				a separate Principal for the Grade School Department. In S.Y. 1993 - 1994, S.
				Ma. Zenaida Sasil, RVM was appointed Principal of the Grade School. She
				was followed by S. Ma. Bernadette Suico, RVM in 1994. The physical set-
				up of the Grade School Department was also changed, giving it separate
				facilities from the High School Department like Library, Faculty Room and
				Computer Laboratory. Likewise, a Guidance Counselor was hired to fully
				serve the needs of the Grade School pupils.
			</p>
		</div>

		<div class="paragraph">
			<p>
				Saint Mary's Academy of Capiz strives toward high technology
				education. In view of this, computer classes were offered starting S.Y. 1993 -
				1994 from Grade IV to High School. In 1995, computer classes were given
				separately to each department from Grades One to Fourth year. A speech
				laboratory was provided for Grades Four to Six and all High School students.
			</p>
		</div>

		<div class="paragraph">
			<p>
				The Kindergarten was not left out in the program of expansion and
				standardization. In the S.Y. 1990 - 1991, S. Ma. Judith Padilla, RVM was
				appointed as the Kindergarten Coordinator. In April 1992, the construction
				of the Kindergarten building started at the west side of the campus behind
				the high school building. It has six classrooms, a playroom, a learning
				center, an office for its coordinator, and a faculty room. It was blessed on
				November 30, 1992. A swimming pool was added to its facilities in the S.Y. 
				1996 - 1997.
			</p>
		</div>

		<div class="paragraph">
			<p>
				The RVM believes in empowering their lay collaborators to be partners
				in the education ministry. In October, 1995, the Board of Trustees appointed
				Mr. Miguel Mac Aposin as Principal of the High School Department. He was
				the first lay principal who administered the High School department from
				1995 to 1998.
			</p>
		</div>

		<div class="paragraph">
			<p>
				The teachers' competence was proven when in S.Y. 1996 - 1997, the
				High School Department topped the Regional Achievement Test given to
				selected private secondary schools.
			</p>
		</div>

		<div class="paragraph">
			<p>
				In S.Y. 1997 - 1998, the school celebrated its Golden Jubilee. The High
				School Department in particular underwent PAASCU re-survey visit
				on February 16 - 17, 1998 after which it was granted a five-year Level II
				Accreditation.
			</p>
		</div>

		<div class="paragraph">
			<p>
				The task of the Principal for both departments has become extensive
				due to the rapid increase of student's population that she needed middle
				lay administrators to help her out meet her functions. In S.Y. 1998 - 
				1999, the Directress-Principal, S. Ma. Rosario Ricafrente, RVM appointed Ms. 
				Mercedita Abas as Grade School Assistant Principal. Ms. Nida Abalayan was 
				appointed as Kindergarten Coordinator in S.Y. 2000 - 2001. Mrs. Hilda Cruz 
				was appointed as High School Assistant Principal in S.Y. 2001 - 2002.
			</p>
		</div>

		<div class="paragraph">
			<p>
				To offer more services to the people of Roxas City and the Province of 
				Capiz, SMAC re-assessed its Community Extension Program. Since Sitio 
				Kalubihan was already receiving regular assistance from the Roxas City 
				Government, the SMAC Administrators and the Social Worker decided to 
				scout for another area that is more in need of its extension services. In July 
				2002, Barangay Calumdum, Tiza was adopted by SMAC as the recipient 
				of outreach programs for its High School Department and in November 
				2002, Barangay Dayao was also adopted as the recipient of the outreach 
				programs of the Grade School Department.
			</p>
		</div>

		<div class="paragraph">
			<p>
				Apart from the two aforementioned adopted barangays, SMAC, through 
				the RVM Sisters, the Fourth Year High School students in coordination with 
				the SMAC Social Worker also gave catechetical services to the students in 
				the nearby public schools, the North Tanque Central Elementary School 
				and the South Tanque Central Elementary School.
			</p>
		</div>

		<div class="paragraph">
			<p>
				To keep abreast with the new trends in education and to continuously 
				offer relevant and high quality education to the Marians, SMAC adapted the 
				new Basic Education Curriculum of the Department of Education starting 
				the S.Y. 2003 - 2004. Enrichments to the curriculum were done (e.g., Christian 
				Living, Computer, etc.) based on the unified curriculum used by the schools 
				run by the Religious of the Virgin Mary.
			</p>
		</div>

		<div class="paragraph">
			<p>
				The PAASCU survey team re-visited SMAC High School on February 26 
				- 27, 2004. The department was granted a five-year Level II Accreditation.
			</p>
		</div>

		<div class="paragraph">
			<p>
				SMAC has always been excelling in cultural and academic competitions. 
				In SY 2005 - 2006, the students of both Elementary and High School 
				Departments won a landslide victory in the Division English Festival. During 
				the First RVM Regional Cultural Contest in Cebu, SMAC garnered the most 
				number of awards. It was in the same School Year when the school was 
				certified by FAPE (Fund for Assistance to Private Education).
			</p>
		</div>

		<div class="paragraph">
			<p>
				It has been the dream of SMAC to construct a beautiful building. June 
				2004 marked the start of construction of the Administration building where 
				the offices, auditorium, chapel, dormitory, and the Sister's convent were 
				housed. The newly constructed edifice was blessed on September 18, 
				2005. The re-assessment of the Community Extension Service in Barangay 
				Calumdum in 2005 resulted to the opening of a new adopted community in
				Brgy. Terel in Tanque.
			</p>
		</div>

		<div class="paragraph">
			<p>
				Quality Catholic Marian education continued to be the hallmark 
				of Saint Mary's Academy of Capiz. In 2006, the Grade School Department, 
				through the courage and competence of the new Directress/Principal, S. 
				Ma. Remy Villaraiz, RVM started to evaluate its operations based on PAASCU 
				standards and worked for its Preliminary Survey Visit on August 30 - 31, 
				2007. The department received its certificate of PAASCU Candidate Status 
				on February 28, 2008.
			</p>
		</div>

		<div class="paragraph">
			<p>
				On its 61st year of existence, Saint Mary's Academy of Capiz welcomed 
				the challenge to remain faithful to its commitment to provide the people 
				of Capiz quality Catholic Marian education as the whole SMAC family 
				embarked on the High School PAASCU Resurvey Visit on January 26 - 27, 
				2009 and the Grade School PAASCU Formal Survey Visit on February 2 - 3, 
				2009. The High School Department was granted another 5-year Level II 
				Reaccredited Status while the Grade School Department received its Level I 
				Accreditation certificate.

				move forward in faith, excellence and service with the guidance of the new 
				High School Assistant Principal Ms. Elnie Templa.
			</p>
		</div>

		<div class="paragraph">
